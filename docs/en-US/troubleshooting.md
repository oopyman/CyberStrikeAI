# Troubleshooting

[中文](../zh-CN/troubleshooting.md)

Debug by layer. Do not change random config before locating the failing layer.

## Diagnostic Order

1. Process: is the service alive, any panic?
2. Network: port, HTTPS, reverse proxy, browser console.
3. Auth: does `/api/auth/validate` return 200?
4. Config: can `/api/config` be read and applied?
5. Model: does model test pass?
6. Tools: do tool list and schemas look right?
7. Database: is `data/` writable, any lock?
8. Subsystem: KB, MCP, C2, WebShell minimal action.

## Minimal Commands

```bash
lsof -i :8080
curl -k -I https://127.0.0.1:8080/
curl -k -I https://127.0.0.1:8080/static/logo.png
ls -lh data/
```

If a reverse proxy is involved, test both proxy address and upstream address.

## Common Issues

Page inaccessible:

- wrong protocol, especially HTTPS vs HTTP;
- self-signed cert warning;
- port occupied;
- reverse proxy loop.

Login fails:

- wrong RBAC user password;
- config not applied/restarted;
- stale cookie;
- audit throttling repeated failures.

Model fails:

- wrong `base_url` path;
- invalid API key;
- model unavailable;
- reasoning fields unsupported by gateway. Try `openai.reasoning.mode: off`.

Streaming stalls:

- proxy buffers SSE;
- model gateway timeout;
- context too large;
- browser/network interruption.

Tool fails:

- real command not installed;
- YAML schema wrong;
- HITL rejected or pending;
- timeout or no-output timeout.

Knowledge base empty:

- `knowledge.enabled` false;
- scan/index not run;
- embedding API failed;
- threshold or risk type too strict.

C2 returns 503:

- expected when `c2.enabled: false`.

## Common Misdiagnoses

- "Model is broken": HITL is waiting.
- "Tool missing": tool_search hides it from current context.
- "Knowledge base useless": index not rebuilt or risk type too narrow.
- "Config saved but ineffective": listener/TLS changes need restart.
- "Robot silent": platform callback or signature config wrong.
